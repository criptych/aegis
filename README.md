AeGIS is an open-source, cross-platform Geographic Information System,
initially conceived with three main goals:

 1. (Primarily) To perform in-depth research on the widely range of subjects
    incorporated by GIS, including geography, mathematics, data processing, and

 2. (Additionally) To get practical software development experience creating a
    medium- to large-scale software application, using source control
    ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)), automated build tools
    ([CMake](https://cmake.org/)), and continuous integration platforms
    ([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com)).
 3. (Ultimately) To promote competition in the field of GIS software by
    providing a user-friendly, performant, and stable alternative to existing
    tools.
